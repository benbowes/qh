This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Code linting

Runs eslint and typescript linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Future steps

I focussed on the business requirements of the code test.
I intentionally stopped working on the test as I was going over time, and I read a note from the hiring manager that was totally ok.

#### Ratings icons

For the ratings icons, I could use pure CSS for both or use an SVG. I would need to chat to the designer to understand the business requirements

I found this CSS star icon:

And the round icon I could do from memory.

#### Component structure

I would put some more time into the component structure as time went on...
